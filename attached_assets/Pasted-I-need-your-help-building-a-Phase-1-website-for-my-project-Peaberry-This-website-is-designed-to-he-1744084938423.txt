I need your help building a Phase 1 website for my project, Peaberry. This website is designed to help coffee enthusiasts in Boston discover specialty cafés. The website must include basic search functionality where users can search for cafés by name, neighborhood, roast level, brewing method, or other relevant keywords.

Additionally, I want the website to feature a filterable list or table of café listings. Users should have the option to toggle between this list view and a map view that displays the café locations. For the map view, please integrate the Google Maps API. The map should have pins dropped on it with clustering enabled to clearly display café locations, and the pin icons should be styled as a coffee cup or coffee bean to signal that they represent coffee-related spots. When a user clicks on a pin, it should display an information window that shows the café’s name, open hours, roast level, and brewing methods, along with a “Get Directions” button that links to Google Maps to find a route from the user's current location to the café.

For filtering, include specific criteria for roast level and brewing method. The roast level filter should have options for Light, Medium, and Dark, while the brewing method filter should offer choices such as Pour Over/Drip, Espresso, Aeropress, French Press, and Siphon.

The website should also include user profiles so that users can save their favorite cafés for future reference. Each café should have a dedicated details page that provides essential information such as the typical roast level, brewing methods, and any other relevant details. In addition, I want users of the Peaberry website to be able to rate each café. Please ensure that these ratings are provided by our users and not sourced from Google Maps.

Furthermore, please build a backend to store café details, user profiles, favorites, and user-generated ratings. The backend should use PostgreSQL as the database system, with clearly defined API endpoints for searching cafés, retrieving café details, managing user favorites, and handling user profile operations.

Lastly, I need users to be able to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication should be handled using OAuth, ensuring a secure and streamlined login process.
